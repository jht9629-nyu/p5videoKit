How to fix following electron error: FATAL ERROR: Oilpan: Large allocation. Ran out of reservation Allocation failed - process out of memory



3. Use node --max-old-space-size Flag:
The V8 JavaScript engine, used by Electron, has a default memory limit for heap allocation 
(around 1.5GB on 64-bit systems). You can increase this limit by using the --max-old-space-size flag.

Modify the start script for your Electron app like this:
bash
Copy code
electron --js-flags="--max-old-space-size=4096" .
This sets the maximum heap memory size to 4GB. Adjust the number according to your machine's capacity.
